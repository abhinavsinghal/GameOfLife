This program generates and displays output based on Conway's Game Of Life paradigm.

The following four criteria need to be met to create the Game of Life grid -
1.There should be no explosive growth.
 2.There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
 3.There should be potential for von Neumann universal constructors.
 4.The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.

In the program, a console is used to input row, column sizes.
The iterations to be run for the cycle are taken as input as well.

A random seed is used to generate the grid initially.
